Hey Friend,

Here is what I recommended to a family friend of mine who is getting into coding. Its the same stuff I used.


RESOURCES:
Most of my classmates used Codeacademy at some point to learn coding. Its a well known resource in programming education. It is a series of guided tutorials. I'd try the Javascript tract as most schools cover javascript. Its really inseparable from web development today. The principles you learn in that language are applicable to other languages. Its syntax is also similar to other languages.
www.codeacademy.com

Codeschool has nice videos that give good overview of web development, which you should start getting a feel for. It has some guided exercises for you to complete:
www.codeschool.com

I recommend a mix of both Codeacademy and Codeschool. Though Codeacademy will definitely involve more coding so don't slack on that.

Repl.it 
Its highly advised to play around with Javascript and explore it in your own fashion too, so you can open up https://repl.it/ and execute code there.

Finally, schools like Fullstack Academy recommend you be able to complete Easy and Medium level practice problems on Coderbyte.
www.coderbyte.com I wouldn't attempt these until you go through some Codeacademy first. The great thing about Coderbyte is that all the shown solutions are actual user solutions. So you can learn a ton by browsing those. Re-attempt these until you can code them on your own without having to look at solutions or do Google searches.

TIME COMMITTMENT:
It will definitely take a couple of months to get to the point where you can complete the Easy and Medium Coderbyte problems on your own.
I went through a lot of Codeacademy in Code school in Dec '14 to Jan '15. Then when I re-located to Brazil I started with the Coderbyte problems in March '15, and wasn't able to complete them all on my own until about May '15. I was also unemployed (only working about 10 hours per week) so it was easy to focus on Coderbyte. I probably spent several hundred hours just toying around with the Coderbyte problems in that site Repl.it, practicing them, experimenting with code.

If you can devote 1 - 2 hours every weekday evening, and a few hours every Saturday and Sunday then you should be at a pretty good position in a few months. They key is to get into it and really get hooked, so then you end up spending your entire Saturday doing it haha and you forget about the time. If you feel like you can do more then just keep going, stay up until early a.m. every once in a while if you're feeling it. 

# Notes on the Easy and Medium level Coderbyte Problems & Solutions:
Majority of the solutions in MEDIUM were written in whole by Will. They are denoted by the comment //WILL
at the start of them.

Most of the solutions for the Easy Exercises were not written in whole by Will. Will attributes this
to the fact that he was still familiarizing himself with array/string methods and regular expressions.

The MEDIUM exercises were actually a lot easier for him. They took him far less time.

Some problems have multiple solutions (recursive, while loop, additional functions defined etc.) listed.
Some of William's notes on programming are commented throughout.
